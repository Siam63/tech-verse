            <h2>Billing and Shipping</h2>
            <p>
              Before you get your amazing new product, you need to fill out a few pieces of information first.
              Please provide us with your shipping and payment information at the checkout page. You will then be prompted to the delivery path and your invoice.
              Once the order is accepted, a message will appear stating whether your order was successful or not.
            </p>
            <p>
              When you are on the checkout page, you will need to choose a date and time for your delivery, including a branch in which your item will be shipped from and grant
              location access on your browser so we can get all the correct information from you! Allowing location access on the browser
              will allow the application to create a path from the branch to your address which will be shown via Google Maps.
